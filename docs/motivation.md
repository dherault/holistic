# Motivation

## A need for 0 CSS UI framework

So far, no React component library offered a 0 CSS standard, i.e. components without styling that give the developer full control on their looks.

This is what a `<Button />` component looks like out of the box:

With honorable, the developer can start from zero to implement the designer's vision.

## Extensible to its core

## default and custom props over `style`
